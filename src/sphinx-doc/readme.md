Sphinx-doc v4 is included into Lootnika. Read about https://www.sphinx-doc.org/

Use conf.py to configure you Sphinx theme. By default Lootnika provide own sphinx_lootnika_theme and conf.py for this.

Note that some themes can be not adapted for Sphinx 4. In this case you need to build Lootnika with older version of Sphinx
